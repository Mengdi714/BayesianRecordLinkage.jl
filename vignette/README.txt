Example data was derived from the supplementary materials of Sadinle (2017).  The code in example.jl is meant to both follow the sequence a possible record linkage pipeline as well to demonstrate a variety of different functions contained in the BayesianRecordLinkage package. In several sections to analysis is therefore run several times to demonstrate the range of functionality and compare different options.
